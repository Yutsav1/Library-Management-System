# LibraryManagement System

### # The Fundamental Idea of this project is:
- **A member has very few privileges to do:**
  - A member has access to viewing the book details and the currently available book. 
  - A member can view own profile.
  - Members can also change the password of their account.
- **An admin has more functionalities:**
  - An admin can view all members as well as their all details.
  - can remove the privilege of a member.
  - can view all book details.
  - can assign or submit any book copy.
  - can delete and add book copies as well as books.
  - can change the password of their account as well as any member's account.

### # Here ***SQLite*** database is used.

### # Please visit the [admin_member_files](https://github.com/Yutsav1/Library-Management-System/tree/main/admin_member_files) directory.
- Here four files are present:
  - [student.txt](https://github.com/Yutsav1/Library-Management-System/blob/main/admin_member_files/student.txt) 
  contains all the registered students of the institute.
  - [faculty.txt](https://github.com/Yutsav1/Library-Management-System/blob/main/admin_member_files/faculty.txt)
  holds all the registered faculties of the institute.
  - Details of the admin of the portal are conferred at [admin.txt](https://github.com/Yutsav1/Library-Management-System/blob/main/admin_member_files/admin.txt).
  - All the registered members are given in [member.txt](https://github.com/Yutsav1/Library-Management-System/blob/main/admin_member_files/member.txt).
- Note, only a valid student or faculty of an institute can only be a library member. And there is no option to register a new admin as only an administrator can decide who could be an admin.
- ***For a better view of these text files, please set the indent size to 4.***
